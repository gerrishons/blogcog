Walk with me through life's merry way. A comrade blithe and full of glee.


We're working on a gadget to complement a white cane. It will be able to scan its surroundings for obstacles or orientation marks, and give a detailed description. This will help visually impaired people to manoeuvre with ease. New features will be announced soon 

### Final Design

Final Design will be posted here soon!
